# Ice-Floe-Research

```  5/22/23: ```  Uploaded ice_floe.ipynb, which is just practice trying to simulate the fracturing of ice floes based off of wavelength and wave period. <br>
```  5/23/23: ```  I am working on adding the features: get the size of each ice floe(Node) in quadtree and add wield function to quadtreeã€‚ <br>
```  5/24/23: ``` Got a model incorporating weld and fractur rates that we can maybe begin appplying to the mesh. <br>
```  5/26/23: ``` Refined the practice model in ice_floe.ipynb and fixed an error with the events. Also added the Probability of each event occuring.
